# Contributing to DeckForge

Welcome, Illumineer! We welcome contributions that help refine the game engine.

### 📜 Our Process
1. **Fork & Branch:** Create a feature branch for your changes.
2. **Standardized Data:** Do not bundle card images. Use references to LorcanaJSON.
3. **Logic over UI:** While we love a pretty UI, our priority is fixing game-state bugs (e.g., proper 'Evasive' handling).
4. **Pull Requests:** All PRs will be reviewed by the Project Lead (usually on a bi-weekly cycle).

### 🚫 Prohibited Actions
- **No Monetization:** Do not add ads, tracking, or "pro" tiers.
- **No Asset Hosting:** Do not upload copyrighted images to this repository.
- **Code Quality:** Ensure all logic is documented and follows the existing React Hook patterns.
